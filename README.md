# g2latex
**ONLY FOR BEGINNERS** Everything that I encountered during the learning of LaTex.
I intend to use LaTex for my Uni assignments, notes, and presentations.

## for notes
 * [My Notes Template Reference-NotesTex](https://github.com/Adhumunt/NotesTeX)  
 * Add **Chinese Language** Support  
  * step 1: `%!TEX program = xelatex` to force the system use the **xelatex** to read my LaTex code  
  * step 2: `\usepackage[UTF8]{ctex}` to use the [ctex (homepage)](http://www.ctex.org/HomePage/) or [ctex (CTAN)](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ctex) package
